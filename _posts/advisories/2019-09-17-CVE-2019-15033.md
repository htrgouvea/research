### Summary

The Pydio[1] is a “modern file management platform built according to your business needs and regulations” and with the CVE-2019-15033[5] an attacker can use one of its main features to send a specific payload to force the backend to send server-side request forgery request's[2] to internal assets.

---

### Description

Pydio's main functionality is file upload and sharing. One way to upload is through the "Remote Server" feature, where Pydio makes a request to a remote server on the Internet and downloads the file.

The problem here is that Pydio does not handle filters properly on the input of this data, allowing a malicious user to enter a URL into an internal address (see also [CVE-2019-15032](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15032)) that is not directly available to the Internet, such as: http://10.11.18.47:1337/pydio-cve.png

And Pydio, in a successful attempt to make such a request, eventually manages to download a file that is not directly exposed to the Internet, thus resulting in an Blind SSRF - Server Side Request Forgery:

- Pydio request:

- The internal web server log:

The scenario here is: Pydio is an online application that is exposed directly to the internet, hosted on a server that has routes to the corporate network of the company in question; The Web Server illustrated earlier is a development environment that is not exposed directly to the Internet. Also, through this Blind SSRF we were able to manipulate Pydio to make a request to this internal web server.

---

### Impact

An attacker could take advantage of the vulnerability to make Pydio make forged internal IP requests on a network, mapping and accessing files from an internal network - for greater effectiveness, this could be automated and correlated to a list of services and files presumably that the target company uses. In addition, there is a very significant margin of being able to align this Blind SSRF with some specific scenario and achieve a RCE vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited without authentication because another feature of Pydio is the creation and making of folders available for third parties to upload and download files.

### Mitigation

Upgrade your Pydio application to last version available.
