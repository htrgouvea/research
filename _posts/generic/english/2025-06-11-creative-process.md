I’ve never read a single book by Mark Manson, but one of his quotes once appeared on my timeline, and I resonate with the line of thought: **“Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause.”** A visual example of this is an image I created back in 2018 while studying my own creative process:

The image represents the cycle of action and motivation, where action is not merely a response to motivation, but also a driving force that fuels new motivation. This leads me to reflect on how creativity manifests in our lives.

Creativity doesn’t come out of nowhere; it is nurtured by a continuous cycle of action and reflection. When we take action—even without initial motivation—we create new experiences and learnings that, in turn, generate new motivations. It’s a dynamic cycle where action and motivation feed into each other.

Motivation, then, is not a fixed starting point but a force that transforms and evolves as we engage in creative actions. This idea echoes Pablo Picasso’s quote: **“Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working.”**

This first point of reflection brings to mind William O’Brien’s quote: **“The quality of an intervention depends on the interior condition of the intervenor.”** Here, I realize that not only motivation but also our internal state play vital roles in the manifestation of creativity. 

Thus, action is not only a result of motivation; it is also shaped by the inner condition of the individual.

**“Creativity is not about magical inspiration or innate genius. It comes after we accumulate vast knowledge through our experiences, but refuse to simply repeat and produce what is always expected of us. We take time in stillness so that, from this emptiness of activity, we can craft something new from our prior influences—something creative and unexpected. Without time and stillness, there is no so-called originality.”**
— From the book: “The Philosophy of Emptiness”

Creativity is a process that requires time and space to bloom. It is in that space of stillness that we can reflect, assimilate our experiences, and allow new ideas to emerge. The phrase by Pablo Gianera, **“El tiempo de la obra de arte es el de la espera”** (“The time of the artwork is that of waiting”), deeply resonates with this idea. Waiting is not emptiness—it is a fertile period where creativity can develop.

**“Things of quality are not afraid of time.”**

Any creation—whether art, software, or an idea—if it is truly of quality, does not need to fear time. In fact, time becomes an ally that proves the authenticity of that creation. If we’re investing time, energy, or any other resource into something that aligns with this principle, we don’t need to fear how much time is being spent. It will be worth it.

**“Writing is easy: you start with a capital letter and finish with a period. In between, you put in ideas.”** — Pablo Neruda
