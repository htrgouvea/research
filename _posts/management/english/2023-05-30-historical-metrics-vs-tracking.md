Continuing the discussion about metrics, another point worth considering and categorizing is the distinction between historical metrics and tracking metrics. Proper use of these metrics can be a differentiating factor. Let me explain:

* Historical Metrics: These serve to portray past events, illustrating through numbers what has already happened. They are useful for helping to develop medium and long-term action plans.

* Tracking Metrics: These aim to provide real-time insights into ongoing events, allowing for the creation of short-term tactics.

To illustrate this, let's use a basic and didactic example:

Imagine we want to measure whether we have succeeded or not with a group of students enrolled in a 12-month course. A strong and direct indicator is the final ratio between the number of students who passed and the number of students who failed.

However, since the course lasts for 12 months, relying solely on this metric would be inadequate, as we would only get the answer to our question too late. Consequently, we would not be able to take immediate actions to improve the situation if it were less than ideal. In other words, this metric is historical.  By observing this metric, we can draw some conclusions and consequently think about new strategies so that the next classes have a higher pass rate.

As for tracking metrics, we can consider the following:

1. Bi-monthly evaluations: These allow us to identify students with a low performance index. We can even conduct evaluations based on categories of disciplines, providing more details about the specific subjects in which students are having difficulties. This allows for short-term changes, such as adjusting teaching methodology, offering additional classes, or recommending support references to students.
2. Monthly attendance rate: Students with low attendance are more likely to fail. By monitoring attendance, we can diagnose the problem, communicate with the student, understand the reasons for their behavior, and make necessary adjustments.

In summary, by considering both historical and tracking metrics, we can adopt a holistic and proactive approach to process and project management. The intelligent combination of these two types of metrics not only allows us to understand the past and present but also empowers us to shape the future more effectively, dynamically adapting to constantly evolving needs and challenges.
