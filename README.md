### Summary

My research focus is vulnerability discovery in applications/services and exploit devlopment, I have fun bypassing modern defenses, exploring systems and playing with new technologies and in parallel: sharing some of my research notes on [my blog](https://heitorgouvea.me); Here, you can find some of my experiments, advisories and analysis of advisories from others researchers.


This repository stores all the structure, code and files of my personal website ([https://heitorgouvea.me](https://heitorgouvea.me)). My website was developed using Jekyll. Its basic structure revolves around this and some HTML5, CSS3 (with sass) and JavaScript files.
